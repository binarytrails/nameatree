# Name a Tree

Hi!

A tree can live up from 40 to 5000 years, such as the Bristlecone Pine. They stay in our world 500 times longer than us. Still, we donâ€™t understand that they are one of our major vital element. How often did you forget to water your plants? This might be normal due to their inertia. They live in a different timeframe than us and at a different speed. Therefore, it is hard for us to relate to them.

This social network will allow anyone to map their local tree by providing personality to it. You arrive on our platform, validate captcha, give the tree a wonderful name, upload an image of it, give it a rating from an available attributes list and if you wish to, you can even write something sweet about it, perhaps a memory of yours.

There might be a section dedicated to interesting facts & news related to their species.

You can access all of the mapped trees by using a standard word map. It is interactive because it allows everyone to see history of the trees around them. It creates a bridge between us humans and our neighbor trees by sharing memories related to them.

Name a tree provides you insight on their past, their forgotten history.
